The script Calories.py is a Python script. If you open it, you should be able to change the sample GPX path
and the recording GPX path. Try downloading new GPX routes off the internet if you want. The default paths
when you first open the file should match the graphs contained in the word document.

To run this script you will need to make sure you've installed the following libraries:

gpxpy
geopy
matplotlib
scipy
numpy

To install these libraries, navigate to the Python home directory in a terminal of your choice (I used
PowerShell) and run:

pip install [libary name]

Please email me if you are having trouble installing these libraries: noah.w.lomas@gmail.com

I recommend viewing the graph windows in fullscreen. Otherwise they're very hard to read.

Thanks for reading!
